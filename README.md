/Project 4 - Inhabitent/

This is a project which tests students abilities relating to HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Wordpress. 

The most challenging aspect of this project was learning PHP and wordpress for the first time. Also the number of webpages involved in this site was more complex than previous sites we had to build.
